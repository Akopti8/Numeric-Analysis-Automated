# Numeric-Analysis-Automated
This repository contains files written in java consisting of algorithms automating tasks taught in Numerical Analysis class.

I have automated the following:

1. Euler's method
2. Least square method
3. Modified Euler's method
4. Gaussian Row Reduction elimination
5. Rungeâ€“Kutta methods
6. Simpson's Rule

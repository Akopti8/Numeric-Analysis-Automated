# Numeric-Analysis-Automated

This repository contains files written in java consisting of algrithims automating tasks taught in Numerical Analysis class. 

I have automated the following: 

1. Euler's method
2. Least square method 
3. Modified Euler's method 
4. Gaussian Row Reduction elimination
5. Runge–Kutta methods
6. Simpson's Rule
